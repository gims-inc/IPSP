                    As a programmer, my primary job is to design, develop, and maintain software applications that meet the needs of end-users. I use programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, and others to write code that instructs computers to perform specific tasks.
                    I start by analyzing the requirements of a project, breaking it down into smaller tasks, and creating a plan to execute each task in a structured and organized manner. I write and test code to ensure it is free of errors and meets
                    the project's specifications. I work with other members of a development team, including designers, testers, and project managers, to ensure that the software is delivered on time and within budget. I also provide support and maintenance
                    for the software after it has been released, including fixing bugs and adding new features.

        Inducing Factors for the Project Choice.</p>
    <p>

        The development of this project was necessitated by a number of factors, which include but are not limited to:
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>
                Increasing demand for a particular service - If there is a growing demand for a particular service, it can be a good opportunity to develop an in-person service provider project to meet that demand.

            </li>
            <li>
                Competitive market - The occurence of other service providers in the market, is one of the driving factors in this project This is to give us a way to stand out and differentiate from competitors, by enabling the clients access the service providers from
                a central point of administration.
            </li>
            <li>
                Targeting a specific customer base - This in-person service provider project is developed to cater to a specific customer base, including demographic. A client is able to access a service provider regardless of the location.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lack of quality service providers - There is a lack of quality service providers in particular areas, thus the developing of this in-person service provider project can be an opportunity to provide high-quality services and fill the gap in the market.
            </li>
            <li>
                Personal passion or interest - Our passion for engineering and coming up with solutions to the real world problems was a key driving factor in this project. We needed to leverage on the new technologies and the automation of the current processes
            </li>

        </ul>
