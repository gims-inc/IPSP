                        the most fundamental phases in the system design cycle as is represented in the diagram attached.This may thus encompass the breaking of the problem down into smaller tasks, and creating a plan to execute each task in a structured
                        and organized manner. Ensuring of a quality and well refined system is very impracticable without the testing of the system. The testing bphase ensures that loopholes in the system are identified, bugs fixed and user satisfied.as per
                        the project's specifications. I passionately cherish teamwork as it gives one a platform for growth, learning, unlearning and relearning.

            Why In-Person Service Provider?</p>
        <p>

            The development of this project was necessitated by a number of factors, which include but are not limited to:
            <ul style="caret-color: blue;">
                <li >
                    Increasing demand for a particular services - If there is a growing demand for these, lests call them "in-person" services, it's therefore a good opportunity to develop an in-person service provider project to meet that demand.

                </li>
                <li>
                    There is a focuss on all the high end, professional services that are mostly offered remotely, paying less attention on the services that require one to provide them in peson. It's thus a good opportunity to provide this solution so as to easily facilitate the 
                    acces to these so called in-person services.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Competitive market - The occurence of other service providers in the market, is one of the driving factors in this project This is to give us a way to stand out and differentiate from competitors, by enabling the clients access the service providers from
                    a central point of administration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Targeting a specific customer base - This in-person service provider project is developed to cater to a specific customer base, including demographic. A client is able to access a service provider regardless of the location.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lack of quality service providers - There is a lack of quality service providers in particular areas, thus the developing of this in-person service provider project can be an opportunity to provide high-quality services and fill the gap in the market.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Personal passion or interest - Our passion for engineering and coming up with solutions to the real world problems was a key driving factor in this project. We needed to leverage on the new technologies and the automation of the current processes
